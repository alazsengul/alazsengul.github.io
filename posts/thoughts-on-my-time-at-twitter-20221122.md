I was notified a few weeks ago that November 4th was my last working day at Twitter, ending my time there as a Software Engineer II.

For over a year, I was fortunate to work under the Ads Callback team. We designed and developed distributed stream processing pipelines and services for high volumes of real-time ad impressions. This required us to interface with ads serving, prediction models, revenue analytics, and billing.

Working at a large tech company right out of college taught me how to deal with problems at scale. As much as I enjoy working on personal projects, they never reach the point of handling millions of users that generate large amounts of traffic. It was awesome to be involved in decision-making for our backend systems that considered even the smallest details to handle this scale. I've felt myself grow as an engineer, and I owe it to my team and mentors at the company.

Twitter had thoughtful employees that I'm lucky to call my friends. I would say that seeing them every day is what I miss most, but that can't be true because I still interact with them almost every day. You can take the person out of the place but not the place out of the person? Or something like that.
