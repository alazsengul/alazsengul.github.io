                        We are specifically serving the University of Miami Health Rights Clinic. The Health Rights Clinic is a medical legal partnership operated in collaboration with the UM Miller School of Medicine. Students participating in the Health Rights Clinic represent multiple clients in different legal matters related to health. Clients are low income patients of the Veteran's Administration, South Florida Aids Network, Jackson Hospital and other medical partners.

                        We began our search asking the question: how can we help libraries provide health-related services? From speaking to staff members at NYC libraries as well as their partnering organizations, we were able to learn about their various health-related services. We noticed a theme related to library health services: educating the public and providing various health resources/services.
                    </p>
                    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid pb-5" src="coms6998/DubD.png">
                    <p>
                        From what we learned, we were able to narrow down our scope to three key questions:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            How might we help libraries advertise their health-related programs and strengthen their digital presence?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How might we help those who don’t have health insurance access other health resources?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How might we help increase the presence of available mental health services through libraries?
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid pb-5" src="coms6998/Synthesis.png">
                    <p>
                        To continue narrowing our focus, we interviewed members of the Queens Public Library, psychologists, and health-services users. We noticed that issues regarding health insurance spanned across many settings, be it libraries, individual practitioners, or even health rights clinics. Specifically, many users expressed difficulty with filling out health forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From speaking with the director of a health rights clinic for low-income populations, we learned how unintuitive it is to fill out forms related to medical processes. At the University of Miami Health Rights Clinic, a non-profit that specifically helps people access health services, the intake process requires filling out 25+ pages worth of confusing paperwork. We realized there was great potential to digitize this process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key PIT concept that guided us was <b>identifying questions and risks most relevant to this population</b>. We asked ourselves: what is the tradeoff between digital complexity and efficacy of a technological solution? We wanted to digitize the process of filling out health forms by developing a clear and user-friendly interface, while also making it accessible to those who may not be very technologically literate, especially since the clinic is frequented by low-income communities. After deliberation, we landed on two different prototypes to help people fill out health forms.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row justify-content-center mt-5">
                <div class="col-9 col-lg-2">
                    <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-5">Prototypes</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-9 col-lg-7">
                    <p>
                        Our prototypes were designed around the question: how can we help people fill out health forms more intuitively? The development of our product was heavily guided by Melissa Swain, J.D., the associate director of University of Miami Health Rights Law Clinic. We learned that currently, the clinic intake process involves clients filling out 25+ pages of confusing paperwork that is printed, filled out, and then entered into the computer by hand. This manual process is seen throughout most other clinics around the country as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current intake process at the clinic:

                    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid pb-5" src="coms6998/Intake.png">
                    <p>
                        Melissa suggested we design an interface capable of being on a mobile device that could be used by the client to fill out forms in an intuitive way and could easily store information for the clinic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key PIT question that guided us with our design was: <b>What risks might not be encompassed by these prototypes?</b> We realized that a big issue we neglected was health data security and privacy risks.

                    <p>
                        Testing the initial prototype, we learned it was important for administrators of this service to keep track of which and when clients completed medical forms. Consequently, we made it a priority to develop a comprehensible dashboard to view patient information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, utilizing this technology on a mobile phone would be essential. Denise Corcoran, Director of Community Library Services at Queens Public Library, stated “A lot of customers don’t even have tablets or computers, most use their phones”. We especially had to be conscious of this since the Health Rights Clinic works with low-income populations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second prototype honed in on the needs particular needs of the U-Miami Health Rights Clinic. While testing this prototype on active healthcare seekers, we received comments such as: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                “This looks very minimal! Keep it as simple as possible.”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Make the text bigger, especially for us old people!”
                            </li>
                        </ul>  
                        We understood that simplicity in the form-filling process had to be our utmost priority and made the necessary UI changes in the next iteration to test on our progress on this goal. 
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-5">High-Fi Prototype</h5>
                    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid pb-5" src="coms6998/HiFi1.png">
                    <p>
                        Following our first testing period, we created a prototype web application that was responsive to any mobile device, tablet, or computer. We used Tailwind CSS for the frontend and Python's Flask for the backend.

                    <p>
                        We tested this prototype on a variety of people, namely Melissa Swain (Associate Director of U-Miami Health Rights Clinic). We learned from this test that not all people have a Social Security Number so we should make this question optional or not ask it at all. Additionally, we believed beforehand that it would be helpful to have a pre-population feature (where previously answered questions would pre-fill on future entries), however, when showcasing this to Melissa, she said it wouldn’t be worth the technical challenge since most form questions are unique and don’t overlap.
                    </p>
                    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid pb-5" src="coms6998/HiFi2.png">
                    <p>
                        <b>TESTING:</b> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After showing Melissa a mock of the dashboard, she expressed how the clinic currently has a lengthy 20 page document with lawyer’s name mapped to clients they’re in charge of and forms they’ve submitted. She stated that it’d be useful to organize this info in a more cohesive manner. Following this test, we developed an integration with the Google Sheets API that would store form responses and be able to read those responses into the user-friendly dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also made sure to test this on healthcare seekers in our immediate network. One older woman was concerned with how long the form would take her to fill out, so we implemented a progress bar. She also stated that some of the questions were confusing (specifically the ‘Do you work’ question), which gave us the opportunity to clarify questions with a help icon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When reviewing the questions in the forms with Jeffrey Lambert, Assistant Director of Digital Inclusion and Workforce Readiness at QPL, he told us that some people may require translation and would appreciate transparency about how people’s health information will be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key PIT question that influenced our design was: <b>What does this test capture or not capture?</b> This is to observe if it actually addresses issues that the U-Miami Health Rights Clinic faces and what were confusing aspects of the design.

                            Our transition from addressing problems in public libraries to our final partner (the University of Miami Health Rights Clinic) was a challenge. We think that the Double Diamond design process is best suited for each problem space, and when we pivoted our project’s focus it may have been helpful to restart the entire process from ground zero.
